        <h3>Random Things</h3>
        <p>
            I don't have any real favorite book or movies.  I've just never found any real interest in media outside of video games.  My favorite food is normally whatever I feel like at the moment, as I like a -LOT- of food.  I can't think of a favorite musician, but my favorite genres at the moments are Rap Metal, J-Metal, Progressive Rock, and Industrial Metal.  My favorite colors are Red, White, Black, Grey, and Purple.  What makes me happy and what makes me feel <a>better</a> when I'm down is to just have my alone time with me and my thoughts.  I tend to surprise people all the time cause I don't state what I can do often, and I like doing so.
